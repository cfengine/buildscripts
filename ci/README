In this 'buildscripts/ci' directory you will find the means to build cfengine packages.
Note that you should ensure that the various projects are all on the same version: core, enterprise, masterfiles, nova, mission-portal all should be on say 3.21.x or 3.18.x or master.

Currently a full build with no dependencies cached takes around 53 minutes with deps and packaging.

Two options: containerize build or "normal" machine (such as virtual machine or actual hardware).

The build is designed for ubuntu-22.04 but could be adjusted in various shell scripts for other platforms. (TODO: do this!)

# containerized build
./clean.sh # cleans any leftover docker bits
./run.sh # builds a docker image, sets it up, runs it in the background, copies local cache into container, runs the build and saves the results
./shell.sh # runs bash in the container for debugging

See /data/buildscripts/ci/build.sh for required environment variables and steps to try manually

# virtual or real machine

For virtual machine such as with vagrant, at $NTECH_ROOT (aka top-level directory containing all CFEngine repositories), init an ubuntu-22.04 vagrant machine so it has access to all your repositories.

vagrant init ubuntu/focal64
vagrant ssh

# note however, that currently you will need to copy /vagrant to a non shared filesystem most likely as vboxsf type doesn't support required hard and soft links for packaging :(
set -ex
repos="\
buildscripts \
core \
enterprise \
masterfiles \
mission-portal \
nova \
"

mkdir -p $HOME/workspace
pwd
for repo in $repos; do
  pwd
  cp -R "$repo" $HOME/workspace
done

# always be careful of trailing slashes with rsync, check it again if you are typing!
rsync -avz /vagrant/cache/ $HOME/.cache/


And then do the following as you would on a real machine:

cd $HOME/workspace
./buildscripts/ci/setup.sh # install needed dependencies/packages/etc
./buildscripts/ci/setup-projects.sh # items which must be done AFTER the container is created with setup.sh, in non-container case must be executed second
./buildscripts/ci/build.sh # run the build, should generate a package

don't use ./clean.sh ./run.sh or ./shell.sh those are specifically for containerized/docker build

If you are running selenium tests in mission-portal, you might need to do a `make -C mission-portal clean` before creating packages as the selenium tests copy some things from the distribution into the repository directory that cause problems with packaging, such as the api directory from nova.

# manual debugging on-host

cat buildscripts/ci/build.sh
# now export the environment variables there (and adjust as needed)
export BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
export ESCAPETEST=yes
export TEST_MACHINE=chroot

then take each step one-at-a-time or re-run as needed

./buildscripts/build-scripts/install-dependencies

Note that you can provide an argument to install-dependencies to just build ONE dependency, such as

./buildscripts/build-scripts/install-dependencies lmdb

If you change the version of a dependency the cache for that should be skipped and the dep rebuilt from scratch.
