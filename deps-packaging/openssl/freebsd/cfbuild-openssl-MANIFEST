CFEngine Build Automation -- openssl

The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,                                              
commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing                                           
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security                                               
(TLS v1) protocols with full-strength cryptography world-wide. The                                              
project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use                                              
the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL tookit                                               
and its related documentation.

OpenSSL is based on the excellent SSLeay library developed by Eric
A. Young and Tim J. Hudson. The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under
an Apache-style licence, which basically means that you are free
to get and use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes subject
to some simple license conditions.
