This repository contains the necessary tools to build and test cfengine packages for various platforms.

## Hardware requirements

By experimentation I have found that building hub packages, which includes php dependency requires more than 1.6G of RAM/swap.
2.6G worked for me, less might work as well.

## Example build of Community Agent

A minimal example would be to build packages for cfengine community agent.
This should be done in an isolated environment such as a dedicated host, virtual machine or linux container.

Install necessary distribution packages.
For example on debian/ubuntu:

```
apt update -y
apt upgrade -y
apt install -y git autoconf automake m4 make bison flex binutils libtool gcc g++ libc-dev libpam0g-dev python3 psmisc libtokyocabinet-dev libssl-dev libpcre2-dev default-jre-headless build-essential fakeroot ntp dpkg-dev debhelper pkg-config nfs-common sudo apt-utils wget libncurses5 rsync libexpat1-dev libexpat1 curl
apt purge -y emacs emacs24 libltdl-dev libltdl7
```

Get the cfengine source code:

```
mkdir $HOME/cfengine
cd $HOME/cfengine
git clone --recursive --depth 1 https://github.com/cfengine/core
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cfengine/buildscripts
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/cfengine/masterfiles
```

Set some environment variables:

```
export NO_CONFIGURE=1
export PROJECT=community
export BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
export EXPLICIT_ROLE=agent
```

Execute the build steps and see that packages are generated:

```
./buildscripts/build-scripts/autogen
./buildscripts/build-scripts/clean-buildmachine
./buildscripts/build-scripts/install-dependencies
./buildscripts/build-scripts/configure
./buildscripts/build-scripts/compile
./buildscripts/build-scripts/package
ls -l cfengine-community/*.deb
```

## General Build Machine Prerequisites

Due to sheer diversity of the environments, build machine is expected to provide strict minimum amount of software (don't forget `--no-install-recommends` on dpkg-based systems):

To access the build machine:

- SSH server
  - Bundled one on Unixes
  - FreeSSHd on Windows
- 'build' account with SSH key installed

To transfer files back and forth:

- rsync on Unixes
- 7z on Windows

To be able to install packages and run tests:

- passwordless sudo access for 'build' account
- sudo should not require TTY (remove 'Defaults requiretty' from /etc/sudoers)

To build everything:

- GCC (gcc)
  - Additionally, libgcc is used on AIX and Solaris only
- GNU make (make)
- libc development package (libc-dev, glibc-devel)
- bison (bison)
- flex (flex)
- fakeroot (but not fakeroot 1.12, it is horribly slow!)

To create packages:

- Native packaging manager
  - rpm-build on RPM-based systems
  - dpkg-dev, debhelper, fakeroot
  - WiX on Windows

To build MySQL library (yeah!):

- g++ (gcc-c++, g++)
- ncurses (ncurses-devel, libncurses5-dev)

To build libvirt:

- pkg-config (pkg-config, pkgconfig)

Anything else is either preprocessed on buildbot slave or built and installed during build.

## Documentation build pre-requisites

- texinfo
- texlive
- cm-super
- texlive-fonts-extra

## Non-requisites

Build machines should not contain the following items, which may interfere with build process:

- CFEngine itself, either in source or binary form (build machines are short-living, so this is not a problem)
- Development packages for anything beside libc to avoid picking them up instead of bundled ones accidentally.
- MySQL and PostgreSQL servers, clients and libraries

The following packages should not be installed on build machines as well, to avoid accidentally regenerating files transferred from buildslave:

- automake
- autoconf
- libtool

## Dependencies

File `install-dependencies` and the relevant subdirectories in `deps-packaging` are the source of this information.
