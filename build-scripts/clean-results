# This script is designed to clean up old directories, specifically keeping the
# five most recently modified ones.

# `$SCHEDULER` is defined in the build-remote script and expands to
# `$PROJECT-$BRANCH-localbuild`

# The `find` command does the following:
# `-mindepth 1`               it won't go into sub-subdirectories
# `-maxdepth 1`               it won't list the current directory itself
# `-type d`                   restrict the search to only directories
# `-and -not -name '.*'`      exclude dot files (e.g. `.git`, `.cache`)
# `-printf '%T@ %f\n'`        print last modification timestamp and filename
#
# Example output from above: `1678886400 dir_name_A`
#
# The `sort` command sorts the output numerically `-n` from oldest to newest
#
# The `head` removes the five newest directories `-n-5`
#
# The `awk` command extracts only the filename
#
# The `xargs` puts each line as the argument of `rm -rf` to remove the remaining
# files
