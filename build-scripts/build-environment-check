# WARNING we alter the buildslave: we remove UNWANTED_DEPS


### SYSTEM PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES ###
# Libtool is unwanted because "libltdl" polutes our package dependencies.
# The rest are wanted only on the machine doing "autogen.sh",
#     aka buildmaster, which is *different* from the buildslaves
### TODO add to the unwanted list:    bison byacc flex
### TODO unfortunately autoconf is installed by autobuild policy
